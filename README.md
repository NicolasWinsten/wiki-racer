A bot that can play the Wikipedia Game very fast!

## Background

The [Wikipedia Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game) involves finding a path between two wikipedia articles through a series of clickable links.  For example, if you want to move from "Chimpanzee" to "Kevin Bacon", a possible path would be: 
<br>**[Chimpanzee -> King Kong -> Monster Movie -> _Tremors_ (film) -> Kevin Bacon]**

This game can be a competition to see who can create the optimal path with the least clicks or who can complete the path fastest.

This project was adapted from an undergraduate assignment I was given in an Intro to Software Development course last year.  The task was to create a bot that mimics a human trying to find a path as quickly as possibly.  I thought the project was fun enough to continue improving it, and this is the result.
